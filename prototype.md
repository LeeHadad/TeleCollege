-Changed the interactivity with the GUI a little bit in a way that makes more sense and looks better
 to the user.

-Started working on the actual implementation of showing the contents of the recieved list in the list
 view Control and switching between the leads list and the Opportunities list.
 
-Next commit will probably be on a sub branch due to it having some integration with the c++ dll code.
